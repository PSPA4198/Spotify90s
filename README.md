# 🎶 Retrofy - A 90s-style Spotify Web Portal 🎶

👾 Welcome to **Retrofy**, the time-traveling version of Spotify that’s here to teleport you straight into the dial-up internet era! Built as part of the *"Round 3 - The Final Show"* Retro Web Design Challenge, this project is a blast-from-the-past reimagining of modern music streaming, served pixelated and neon-drenched—90s-style.

## 🧠 Concept

What if Spotify existed in the year 1998?

Imagine this:
- You’re online via a noisy modem.
- You've got a Winamp skin that burns your retina.
- Music genres are represented by pixel icons.
- Everything is **scrolling**, **blinking**, or **under construction**.

That’s what this site delivers.
